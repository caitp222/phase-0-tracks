<h1>Hello!</h1>
<h2>Welcome to the Official Nico The Brooklyn Cat Fan Page.</h2>
<p>This page is dedicated to my roommate's cat Nico, who is an extremely minor <a href=https://www.instagram.com/nico_the_brooklyn_cat/>Instagram</a> celebrity.</p>
<p> She is a <strong>beautiful</strong> cat, as you can see in the portrait below.</p>

<p>Look at those gorgeous eyes. Here are some other wonderful things about Nico:</p>
<ul>
<li>She likes to cuddle.</li>
<li>After cuddling, her hair will be <em>all over you.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These are her top 3 favorite places to be stroked, in descending order:</p>
<ol reversed>
  <li>Her ears.</li>
  <li>The back of her neck.</li>
  <li>Her chin.</li>
  </ol>
