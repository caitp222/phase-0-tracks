<!--Reflection:
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to provide meaning and degrees of importance to elements in a webpage. Since beginning CSS, I've found the section and div tags to be the most useful as they allow you to make broad changes to the way the page looks.

The browser displays the elements in the order they're written in the html, unless the CSS is used to change that.

The Html+tab snippet is so wonderfully useful, I'll definitely be creating more snippets at a later date!

Colspan and rowspan were really difficult, apparently my head is not well equipped for picturing tables based on html code. I'll have to practice to get used to reading the code for tables.
