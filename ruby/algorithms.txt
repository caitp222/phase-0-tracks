Write the algorithm for using an elevator. Remember, robots are not smart at all, so you'll have to spell everything out.
 
Find the numbered buttons in the elevator. Look at the one on the bottom row on the left. 
If the number or marking on the button matches the floor assigned, press button.
If not, look at the button to the right to see if matches the floor assigned.
When there are no more buttons in the row, look at the left-most button on the second row up and repeat step above until the number matches the assigned floor.
 
Come up with an example of a common task in your life that could be translated into an algorithm, and write out the steps, labelled with the name of the task.
 
Finding room on the subway in morning rushhour. 
 
Starting at the very first door, look inside. If there is space for you in there, then enter.
If there is not enough space for you, move on to the next door and look inside to see if there is space for you there.
If the doors close before space is found, return to the front of the platform and start again when the next train arrives.
