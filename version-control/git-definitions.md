# Git Definitions

Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a process that allows several people to work on a piece of software at the same time. It is useful as it avoids conflicts between two or more developers and because if a mistake has been made, you can backtrack and see when it happened. You can also see when a piece of code that has created a bug was put into the software. More generally, it tracks all changes that have been made, when they were made and who by.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is another version of the same repository. It allows you to make changes without affecting the original or master version. The changes can be merged into the master branch later.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a point at which a developer has saved the changes they've made to the software. A good message clearly communicates what has been changed so another user knows what work has been done.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict happens when the same piece of code has been changed on two different branches and git can't tell which changes to apply when one branch is merged into the other.
