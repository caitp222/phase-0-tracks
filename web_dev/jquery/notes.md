#JQuery Study Plan

1. Find and read the top section of the JQuery Wikipedia page.
2. Find a brief introduction to JQuery online.
3. Find a list of JQuery functions similar to the Ruby docs, read through what they do and find some to test.

#Reflection

I was glad to have found a brief introduction so I understood what JQuery was, but mostly I learned from looking at documentation and examples of code.
